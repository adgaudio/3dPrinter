3dPrinter - The software side to building and using your own 3d printer!
---

This repo contains a collection of openscad parts I've designed.  Some
of them are posted on Thingiverse.


- `random_parts` An unorganized collection of one-off projects and small parts.
- `lib` Openscad modules that I very occassionally use to facilitate designing prints.
- `external` Other people's libraries that I depended on once or twice.
- `gears` A small collection of gears and an enclosure box for them.
- `dive_lights` Inserts and experiments with scuba lights. I proposed with these!

Git submodules:

- OpenSCAD-Tools - contains a very useful python script called
    openscad_exporter that I use all the time to export multiple stls from
    a single scad file
- OpenSCAD_connectors - a library of connectors for aluminum extrusions
- dlp_printer - the designs for a DLP Stereolithography printer I built.


Check out gettingStarted.sh for install notes I follow to install the
software that I use on my reprap.
